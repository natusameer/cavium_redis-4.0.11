This README is a reference document to run REDIS benchmark tests. This can be run on both Intel and ThunderX2 machine.

Source Code
-----------
Redis Stable Version (Label 4.0.11) is used to run Redis Server/Client tests.
A modified version to get desired results is stored in github repository mentioned below

	$ git clone https://github.com/natusameer/cavium_redis-4.0.11.git

Building Redis
---------------
	$ cd cavium_redis-4.0.11
	$ make distclean
	$ make -j

Running Redis Benchark Tests
-----------------------------
> Automated Script
  ----------------
	bench.sh is an automated script to run Redis Server and Client on LOCALHOST

	$ bash bench.sh [-h] [-n <requests>] [-P <num requests>]

		-h  show this help text
		-n  set the number of requests. Default 1000000
		-P  Pipeline <numreq> requests. Default 1 (no pipeline)

	Results will be stored in csv format. e.g. results_64.csv

NOTE: If Redis Server and Client has to run on Seperate Machines, then it has to be run individually.

> For Redis-Server
  ----------------
	The following command starts Redis-Server with 256 Instances
	$ bash redis_server.sh [-h] [-I <Client Instances>]

		-h  show this help text
		-I  Set number of Client instances. Default 512

> For Redis-Client
  ----------------
	The following command starts Redis-Client.

	$ bash redis_client.sh [-h] [-s <SERVER_IP>] [-n <requests>] [-P <num requests>] [-I <Client Instances>] [-S < Output Summary >]


		-h  show this help text
		-s  set the server IP value. Default: 127.0.0.1
		-n  set the number of requests. Default 1000000
		-P  Pipeline <numreq> requests. Default 1 (no pipeline)
		-I  Set number of Client instances. Default 64
		-S  Output Result Summary to STDOUT. Default 1

> Results
  -------
	Results will be stored in CSV format.
	e.g. for 256 Server/Client instances, results will be stored in "results_256.csv"


At the end of test, kill the Redis server.
	$ sudo killall redis-server
