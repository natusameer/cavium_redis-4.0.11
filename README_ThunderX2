This README is a reference document to run REDIS benchmark tests over ThunderX2 machine.

Source Code
-----------
Redis Stable Version (Label 4.0.11) is used to run Redis Server/Client tests.
A modified version to get desired results is stored in github repository mentioned below

	$ git clone https://github.com/natusameer/cavium_redis-4.0.11.git

Building Redis
---------------
	$ cd cavium_redis-4.0.11.git/
	$ make distclean
	$ make -j

Running Redis Benchark Tests
-----------------------------
> For Redis-Server
  ----------------
	The following command starts Redis-Server with 256 Instances
	$ bash redis_server.sh

> For Redis-Client
  ----------------
	The following command starts Redis-Client.

	$ bash redis_client.sh -s [SERVER_IP]

	It will bind the Redis Clients to specific SERVER_IP. By default it binds to LOCALHOST (127.0.0.1).
	If required, please check for help with -h option.

> Results
  -------
	Results will be stored in CSV format.
	e.g. for 256 Server/Client instances, results will be stored in "results_256.csv"


At the end of test, kill the Redis server.
	$ sudo killall redis-server
